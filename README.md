## :rocket: Introduction

    Dante must journey through Hell, a thoroughly maze-like place. Here we‚Äôre going
    to generate mazes, find the exit path and try to do this as fast as possible.

    The project is divided into nine sections, which represent the nine circles of
    Hell that Dante must pass through in order to reach purgatory.

    The goal of this project is to generate mazes (in a reasonable amount of time),
    solve them (in a reasonable amount of time), and print the solution.
